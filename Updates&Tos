Terms of service:
No leaking
No Impersonating Creator
Abusing Exploits in HVH servers. (ex: No head, Hitpart, Kill all. In this case I will disable server crasher.)
No begging for new version without permission from creator

Risks:
Chances of permanent blacklist.
You will keep the version the owner gave you, but updates will no longer be capable after breaking the tos.
Lost connection to prediction, AKA worst than first stormy. (can only kill bloxtap, confirmed hexagon can destroy you without prediction.)

How do I get the current version?
By chances, if you get enough trust with the creator, Theres a chance he will give access to Voidclient.
What's His username and tag?
In this case I will not be adding that in here. goodluck.

Disadvantages about voidclient:
crashes almost 40% when fakelag is on, 90% when a new player joins a new team
